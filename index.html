                                <p>Certainly, growing up in Greece during the Global Financial Crisis might have been the main reason I am an economist.
                                You see, knowing what exactly caused that crisis and how the world works (because "everything is about money", isnâ€™t it?) fascinated me. 
                                I still get chills when I find a new book explaining with unprecedented concepts and models how the economy <s>works</s> might work and what we got wrong or simply have been unable to see all these years.  </p>

                                <p>But economics is not my only passion. Having observed the power of data analytics, I found myself studying this field and put it into practice for business development. 
                                Wandering at these paths, I was led to learn more about machine learning and A.I. which by itself, made me to dive deeper into computer engineering. </p>

                                <p>And, here I stand now. A Business Analyst, with knowledge of Economics, Business Development, Data Analytics, Machine Learning and, in the near future, Computer Science.</p>

                                <p>When I'm not racking my brain trying to understand the world's functioning, you will find me at a pool swimming, a mountain hiking, a restaurant with my friends and family or in my living room, reading a book.
